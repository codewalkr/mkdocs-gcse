# Take the quiz

1. Name the parts of the CPU that perform the following functions:
    1. carries out arithmetic and logical computations                  (ALU)
    2. stores data within the CPU itself                                (Registers)
    3. coordinates the activities of the CPU and computer               (CU)



* The CPU consists of integrated circuits in the **microprocessor** of a computer.

* The CPU is responsible for **processing**
information and controlling the computer.

* In the CPU are the **control unit**, which manages the execution of the instructions, and the **ALU**, which performs mathematical and logical computations.

* In the CPU are storage locations called **registers**.

* One of these is the program **counter** which contains the location of the current instructions.

* The CPU communicates with other components such as memory through bundles of signal wires called **buses**

## Fetch execute cycle

* Instructions and data are stored in **RAM**

* A register called the **program counter** holds address of the next instruction to be **executed**

* This is transmitted through the **data bus**.

* The instruction is **decoded** by the **control unit** and passed to the **arithmetic and logic unit**, which carries out the instruction.
