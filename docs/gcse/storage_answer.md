# Storage Quiz

1. Describe the functions of random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM).

**RAM is the short-term memory of your computer, and said to be "volatile" meaning anything stored in RAM will be lost when powered off.**

**ROM is the permanent memory of your device, primarily used to store the BIOS of a computer**

2. List two basic differences between RAM & ROM.

**RAM is Volatile: It is temporary. ROM is Non-Volatile: It is permanent.**

**RAM is for "Doing": It is used for reading and writing data at high speeds, typically while using apps.**
**ROM is for "Starting": It is primarily "read-only," meaning the computer usually only looks at it to follow instructions. It holds the "firmware" needed to boot up the hardware before the operating system even loads.**

3. Complete the following:

RAM stands for **Random** **Access** Memory. It is where a **programs** instructions are stored after they have been loaded from disk so that they can be accessed more **quickly** by the CPU. 

Instructions and data are stored in **binary** format at specific locations called memory **addresses** which can be accessed in any **order**. 

The main memory is made of **dynamic** RAM which is slower (but cheaper) than **static** RAM as it needs to be constantly **recharged** or refreshed.

4. Complete the following:

**RAM** is used to store data and programs in use by the computer. 

The memory can be divided into chunks called **pages**. If there is not enough memory to load more data, some is moved to a **paging file** on the **hard disk drive**. The data that is swapped out is the **least used**.

Moving the data in and out of memory **slows** the execution of the program.

If the memory is very low then the computer may have to continually swap data in and out, this if called **disk thrashing**. 

5. From lowest to hightest denomination put these in order:

**TERABYTE (TB)**
**GIGABYTE (GB)**
**MEGABYTE (MB)**
**KILOBYTE (KB)**
**BYTE**
**NIBBLE**
**BIT**
